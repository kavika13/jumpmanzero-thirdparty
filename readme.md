##About this repository

This is the third-party installers/sources repository for [the main `jumpmanzero` repository](https://github.com/kavika13/jumpmanzero). Specific versions of SDKs needed to build the project are stored here.

Clone this only if you need to install SDKs for the main repository (only if you need to build the sources yourself), as this repot is huge.

Note that currently some of the downloads are from untrustworthy sources. I have scanned them for viruses and done my best to ascertain their origin, though there is no way to know for certain these files are legit. I didn't get them from Microsoft because I don't have an MSDN subscription and these are no longer hosted on their site.  Microsoft alkso doesn't publish official checksums of these downloads.

In the future I will update Jumpman Zero to use more recent SDKs that can be verified. I will be ditching DirectX entirely and going with OpenGL. If there is no use for this repot at that time then I will delete it.
